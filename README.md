This is a code of algorithm genetic for travel salesman problem and written in python language.
I use TSPLIB benchmark as my data to evaluate the algorithm. you can check here http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/ to get another data of TSP such as in TSP Simetris or Asimetris.
Here I only use Data TSP Simetris with the name file "att48.tsp.gz"

📝File "Code_1.ipynd" is a using genetic algorithm where:
- Initial population generation: random initialization method
- Selection: Roulette Wheel Selection
- Crossover: Two Point Crossover
- Mutation: Exchange Mutation
- Elitism


What I use✏️✏️✏️✏️✏️
- Python 3.9.13
- anaconda 2022.10
